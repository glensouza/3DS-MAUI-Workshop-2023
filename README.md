# 3DS MAUI Workshop 2023

## Workshop Overview

Hello, and welcome to `.NET MAUI workshop`. This workshop is intended for you developer who are looking to see if `.NET MAUI` is the right framework to use in your development shop as the cross‑platform mobile development.

`.NET MAUI` is Microsoft's development framework for creating high‑quality enterprise applications for mobile and desktop platforms. `.NET MAUI` is the evolution of the Xamarin.Forms framework.

In this workshop you will learn hands-on:

- How you can write shared code that will run on multiple platforms.
- How it fits in as part of the .NET ecosystem.
- How it compares to some of the alternatives.
- We'll go over the hardware and software requirements for getting started.
- We'll build a sample application that will run without any code changes on multiple platforms.
- With that demo, we'll take a quick look at how data binding can be used to make it easy to wire up your data to the controls on the screen.

When you're finished with this workshop, you'll have an understanding how you can be more productive with creating apps when you use `.NET MAUI`.
