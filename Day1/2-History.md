# A Brief History of `.NET MAUI`

Let's start by taking a brief historical journey to gain an understanding of the origins of `.NET MAUI`.

- Shortly after Microsoft announced the .NET Framework in 2000, a company called Ximian unveiled an open source project aimed at bringing .NET to Linux.
- Ximian was later acquired by Novell in 2003.
- In 2004, the Mono framework was released.
- Following that, MonoTouch for iOS was launched in 2009, offering wrappers for iOS frameworks and integration with Xcode build tools. Developing a MonoTouch app followed a similar process to creating an Objective-C app.
- In 2011, Android support was introduced as Mono for Android, which provided a C# layer for Android Java development.
- Novell was acquired by Attachmate in the same year, leading to the Ximian team being laid off. However, they regrouped and formed Xamarin, with Novell granting Xamarin a perpetual license for the Mono technology. MonoTouch became Xamarin iOS, and Mono for Android became Xamarin Android.
- In 2014, Xamarin.Forms was introduced, offering a cross-platform abstraction layer utilizing Xamarin Android and Xamarin iOS. This allowed developers to design a single UI that could utilize native UI controls during runtime, eliminating the need for separate iOS and Android UIs.
- Microsoft acquired Xamarin in 2016, transforming it into a free tool bundled with Visual Studio, previously a paid product.
- The Xamarin SDK was subsequently made open source.
- MAUI stands for: ***`M`ultiplatform-`A`pplication-`UI`***
- Work on `.NET MAUI` began with version 5 of the .NET Framework, set for release in November 2020. However, the task of unifying the Xamarin framework with the rest of .NET required more time and couldn't be completed within the .NET 5 release cycle. Consequently, Microsoft decided to postpone `.NET MAUI` to .NET 6, scheduled for release in November 2021.
- Even at the time of .NET 6 release, `.NET MAUI` remained in a partially beta state. It was officially launched in the spring of 2022, successfully achieving the goal of framework unification.
- Microsoft has followed an annual release cadence for .NET since the introduction of .NET 5. In November 2022, .NET 7 was released, which included version 7 of `.NET MAUI`.
